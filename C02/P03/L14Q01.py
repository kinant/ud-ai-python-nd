# Part 1: Define the dictionary
# TODO: replace None with appropriate code
# Define a dictionary, `model_accuracies`, that provides information
# on the accuracies of different image classification models.
# The key is the name of a model (a string), and the associated value
# is its accuracy (a float).
#   Key      |   Value
# ResNet     |   0.91
# AlexNet    |   0.85
# VGG        |   0.88
# Inception  |   0.92
model_accuracies = {
    "ResNet" : 0.91,
    "AlexNet" : 0.85,
    "VGG" : 0.88,
    "Inception" : 0.92
}

# Part 2: Calculate the average accuracy
# TODO: replace None with appropriate code
average_accuracy = sum(model_accuracies.values()) / len(model_accuracies)

# Part 3: Find the best model
# TODO: replace None with appropriate code
best_model = max(model_accuracies, key=model_accuracies.get)

# Part 4: Add a new model
# TODO: replace None with appropriate code
# Add the model MobileNet with an accuracy of 0.89
new_model = 'MobileNet'
new_accuracy = 0.89

# Add the new model to the dictionary
