Please Note:

1. Project code is in folder PR02 inside the repo
	- https://github.com/kinant/ud-ai-python-nd/tree/main/PR02

2. Notebook HTML file is: Image Classifier Project_V2.1_Final.html

3. Notebook submitted is pretty simple, but if you want more details as to how I got there,
You can look at previous versions of the notebooks that I saved in the project folder. 

3. I used the following resources for help:
- https://www.kaggle.com/code/tirendazacademy/cats-dogs-classification-with-pytorch
- https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html

4. For some of the util functions, I used my old code from 2019 as reference, from when I passed the nanodegree
with another email account. This is a private repo but I can make it public or share it if necessary.
I decided to start this nanodegree from scratch since I pretty much forgot everything since 2019.
